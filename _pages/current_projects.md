## Moralization beyond moral convictions

**Collaborators:** Sergio Barbosa, William Jiménez Leal

Morality can bring out the best and the worst in human beings. Moreover, it is dynamic. Many things that are considered moral today were not so years ago. How does the moral status we attribute to a behavior or attitude change? In this project, we study moralization by expanding the methodological paradigm beyond moral convictions.

## Folk conception of the good life

**Collaborators:** William Jiménez, Santiago Amaya

The idea of the good life we hold can determine what we aspire to, how we feel, our attitudes towards life, and how we seek happiness. If our notion of the good life includes luxuries and extravagances (commonly promoted on social media), we may aspire to have these things, feel depressed if we fail to attain them, and care little about the consequences such levels of consumption may have on the planet. In this project, we study folk conceptions of the good life and their nomological network.

## Self-Control in Context

**Collaborators:** Juan Pablo Bermúdez, María Alejandra Grisales, William Jiménez Leal

Individuals with limited resources often exhibit counterproductive behaviors that hinder their goal attainment. Why is this? In this project, we study the cognitive impacts of poverty by challenging the prevailing theoretical model, the theory of overload, with a novel proposal: the role of contextual evidence provided to individuals with limited resources.

## Folk conception of addictions

**Collaborators:** Federico Burdman, María Fernanda Rangel

Individuals with addictions have been harshly discriminated against and stigmatized. In this project, we study the intuitive ideas people hold about individuals with addictions, whether they can control their behavior, and if they are responsible for their actions. These ideas may explain the negative stereotypes surrounding people with addictions.

## Social evaluation

**Collaborators:** (Not specified)

People evaluate each other. These evaluations are crucial for navigating social life and knowing whom to engage with and whom to avoid. But how does this evaluation process work? In this project, we study social evaluation to understand which dimensions matter most to people. Is it important that your colleague is competent? What if they are rude and hostile? But what if, despite these traits, they have an impeccable moral character? All these considerations matter, and we aim to determine their relative importance.
