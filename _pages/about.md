Human beings are neither rational nor irrational. We are not angels, but we are not demons either. We have virtues and vices, skills and limitations, qualities and flaws. No one is completely good or bad, either morally or cognitively. Everyone is an amalgamation of good and bad traits. This shouldn't be disappointing. Rather, it makes us the most fascinating beings on Earth. Follow me to study how people make decisions, revealing the best and the worst of themselves.
