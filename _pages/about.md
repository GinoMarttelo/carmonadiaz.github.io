I am a psychologist currently finishing my PhD in Psychology at los Andes University, while working as a research assistant on the Self-Control in Context project at the Externado University of Colombia.

My areas of specialization include Behavioral Sciences, Moral Psychology, Polarization, Misinformation, Environmental Psychology, and Self-Control.

My current research focuses on the moralization process, folk conceptions of the good life, pro-environmental behaviors, social evaluation judgments, and the influence of socioeconomic status on people’s decision-making processes.

When I'm not working on my research, I enjoy reading literature (I love Gabo, Saramago, Twain, Ruiz Zafón, and J.K Rowling) cooking, hiking with my dog, and working on my garden and composter.
