I am a psychologist currently finishing my doctorate in Psychology at Universidad de los Andes, while working as a research assistant on the Self-Control in Context project at the Externado University of Colombia.

My areas of specialization include Behavioral Sciences, Moral Psychology, Polarization, Misinformation, Environmental Psychology, and Self-Control.

My current research focuses on the moralization process, folk conceptions of the good life, folk conceptions of addiction, social evaluation judgments, and the relationship between socioeconomic status and self-control.
