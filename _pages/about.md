I am a psychologist and PhD in Psychology with experience in behavioral science, moral psychology, and applied research on decision-making. I work at the intersection of human behavior and emerging technologies, using both quantitative and qualitative methods to understand how people think, choose, and interact with complex environments.

My areas of specialization include Behavioral Science, Moral Psychology, Polarization, Misinformation, Environmental Psychology, and Self-Control. I also work with AI-driven text analysis and recently developed a tutorial on how to use large language models (LLMs) for qualitative and mixed-methods research—part of my interest in building intelligent, human-centered research tools.

My research examines moralization processes, folk conceptions of the good life, pro-environmental behaviors, social-evaluation judgments, and the influence of socioeconomic status on decision-making.

Outside of research, I enjoy reading literature (I love Gabo, Saramago, Twain, Ruiz Zafón, and J.K. Rowling), cooking, hiking with my dog, and tending to my garden and compost system.
