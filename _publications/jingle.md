title: "Evaluating the Convergence of Dimensions Across Social Evaluation Models"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/jingle
excerpt: 'A recent adversarial collaboration integrated dimensions proposed in five major theories of social evaluation into two overarching dimensions: Horizontal and Vertical. This paper examines the convergence in how evaluative dimensions have been operationalized for each model to determine if they address the same constructs. Across various coding strategies and using two similarity indexes, we found robust evidence of low convergence in the traits used to operationalize dimensions assumed to represent the same constructs. These results suggest that the integration proposed by the adversarial collaboration might be limited, as it is unclear whether dimensions within the Horizontal and Vertical domains correspond to the same constructs. We discuss the theoretical and methodological implications and propose recommendations for refining construct operationalization.'

A recent adversarial collaboration integrated dimensions proposed in five major theories of social evaluation into two overarching dimensions: Horizontal and Vertical. This paper examines the convergence in how evaluative dimensions have been operationalized for each model to determine if they address the same constructs. Across various coding strategies and using two similarity indexes, we found robust evidence of low convergence in the traits used to operationalize dimensions assumed to represent the same constructs. These results suggest that the integration proposed by the adversarial collaboration might be limited, as it is unclear whether dimensions within the Horizontal and Vertical domains correspond to the same constructs. We discuss the theoretical and methodological implications and propose recommendations for refining construct operationalization.
